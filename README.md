This project will cover the Fibonacci Sequence and the merge sort.

## Post-project Review

Recursive methods are a headache. I admittedly had to peek at other answers for the fibonacci numbers one just to see how the answer could be returned as an array. Some answers weren't doing that and were returning just the last number in the sequence like I was doing.

I was able to work through the merge sort method on my own after looking at the resources on the project page; especially the visualizer.
